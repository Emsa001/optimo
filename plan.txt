Room renovation

1. Project: Make a detailed project of renovation (new shape of the room, wall colors, new furniture placement, etc...) including the budget.
2. Preparations: Purchase new furniture and all other necessary products. Then move all the furniture out of the room, and clean the walls, that have to be painted. Secure all the power sockets and window corners with tape. The room should be empty before the renovation.
3. Hire constructors, or start the renovation by yourself. Remember to stick to the plan, to avoid problems. 
4. Demolish the walls, you've planned to remove and start building new ones, before that remember to properly secure your floor, to avoid unwanted damage.
5. Start painting the walls layer by layer, remember to wait at least 12 hours before painting another layer.
6. After the walls are built and painted, clean the room after the whole process, and move new/old furniture into the room.
